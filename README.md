`ChainSub` is a media platform where you can get paid with Turtle Coin and various other cryptocurrencies (TBA) for your content.

> `ChainSub` was inspired by [Turtle Coin Hackathon](https://crypto-hackathon.com/), and is still in early beta.

First and foremost we want to express our gratitude to Turtle Coin community end developers for giving us that opportunity.

This project is only possible thanks to @zpalmtree and @brandonlehmann amazing work on `turtlecoin-wallet-backend-js` and `turtlecoin-utils`, these two packages are used extensively on ChainSub backend server, to provide the wallet functionality and blazing fast blockchain synchronization.
